## This is the guide to file structuring

Name all the Folders as LABS or WEEKS
Keep a Folder called Class Programs which has all the codes the professor has given in the Class

- Separte them into subtopics if possible
  (like Arrays,Linked List,Stacks,Queues,Trees,Graphs,Heaps,Hashing)
- Name the files alphanumericaly with [temp(i++) for Sir's codes] and [test(i++) for your own codes].
  - This avoids naming conflict between yours and sirs.
